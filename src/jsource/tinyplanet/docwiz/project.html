Goals</h2>
Don't let DocWiz's Beta designation scare you, it's actually quite stable
and usable, but is missing what I consider to be essential features.
<p>Before declaring version 1.0 ready, I will make the following
requirements:<br>
<ul>
<li>Solid Java and JavaDoc parsing engine (currently there are very few known
bugs)
<li>A decent command-line interface, using GNU Getopt (done)
<li>Clean interoperability with most development environments (done)
</ul>
I'd also like to have a freeware install program.
<p>After 1.0, I plan to go to a split development tree, with even numbered
releases being considered stable and experimental odd numbered releases.
<p>Here's a rough outline of how DocWiz development might progress from
there:
<ul>
<li>1.2: External editor invocation, javadoc invoker
<li>1.4: Java 2 compliance (actually, this got done earlier than I thought)
<li>1.6: Persistent customization, extensible tag framework (again, some of this is done already)
<li>1.8: Tag templates (partially done with 0.67, you can now choose previously entered text from a drop down list)
<li>2.0: Intelligent documentation hints for side-effects and the like
<li>1000000.0: Writes all the documentation for you
</ul>
<p>None of this is set in stone and is highly dependent upon how
willing everyone is to contribute.

<H2><a href="index.html#top">DocWiz</a> : <a href="#top">Project DocWiz</a> :
Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>DocWiz doesn't check for read-only files, bad when you're using some version control systems.
<li>Unicode input is not fully supported, though "escaped" Unicode supposedly
works correctly.
<li>There are a few quirks when documenting inner classes.
<li>Some grid controls don't automatically resize properly under Solaris.
</ul>

Contribute</h2>
<p>You can help out by fixing bugs and adding new features. I've got several
tasks in mind that would be great for someone just starting out.
<p>But if that's not your bag, there's other stuff for you
to do as well. I need a compelte set of icons and a good-looking logo. I want
to have a gallery of screenshots, showing DocWiz running under various
operating systems.
<p>DocWiz needs a good automated testing setup, with a broad variety of input
files.
<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://www.gjt.org/servlets/JCVSlet/list/gjt/com/tinyplanet">
latest development sources</a> via CVSWeb. DocWiz's version control is
provided by the <a href="http://www.gjt.org/">Giant Java Tree</a>.

Status</h2>
DocWiz is currently quite stable and usable. It's lacking a couple of
features that would really make it shine, but I use it all the time to
document my own source code.

Versions</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Beta 0.67 2001-09-07</b>. Many new features and enhancements, mostly courtesy of Lee Meador. Among other things:
<ol>
<li>Drag and drop works for moving tabs between
the panes. Their  location
is preserved when the program closes and
reloads.
<li>The unknown tags pane works. (Note: if you
change a tag like "parm" to
become "param" it will move off the unknown
tags pane to its regular
position, if there is a parameter with that
name, when you change to
another pane and then return.)
<li>The split pane positions are now saved
across program invocations. The
bug that changed the pane size when you
clicked another tab is fixed.
<li>The tabs display correctly in the comment
view and code view panes.
Those panes now use courier font (which is
monospaced).
<li>More changes done to the unknown tags. Any
tag that can not be entered
on the main tag edit pane appears on the
unknown tag pane. This would
include multiple @return tags or @since tags.
It would include @param
tags with variable names not in the parameter
list (but they appear in
both places so you can edit or delete them.)
<li>The default option in the Open file dialog
is to only show .java
files.
<li>There is a preferences pane.
<li>Preferences are present to select how the
comment will look, to some
degree. Single line comments can be allowed
for each item type.
<li>Preferences are present to tell how to
handle private items. For each
type of item (Method, Field, Constructor,
Class, Interface) you can have
private items appear normally, or in grey
(but still selectable) or not
be shown.
<li>Preferences are present for the tab size
and max line length.
<li>There is a preference to tell whether to
show the word public,
private, etc. in the list pane with the code
item's name.
<li>The about box (and preferences box) appear
centered on the main
window.
<li>Fixed a bug displaying comments and white
space among the "tokens"
returned from the parser. The comments were
in reverse order. The code
display looks much better.
<li>There's a manifest file, so you can run
the program with "java -jar
DocWiz0.67.jar"
</ol>
<li><b>Beta 0.66 2000-07-12</b>. User interface is new AppPane style. Uses a Metal 
theme to get system colors. Some user preferences now remembered between sessions,
including working directory, window size and pane placement. Numerous small editing
annoyance bugs cleaned up. Java 2 now required.
<li><b>Beta 0.65 1999-06-24</b>. Fixed serious problem with commenting
methods and constructors with no arguments (bug report by
Matt Mastracci).

<li><b>Beta 0.64 1999-06-10</b>. Fixed ordering of @param tags (bug report by
June Smith). Inner class parameters and exceptions no longer reported as
part of containing method (bug report by Matt Mastracci).

<li><b>Beta 0.63 1999-05-16</b>. Fixed output bug
which caused comments to show up twice (bug report from Keith Fetterman).
Most file operations moved to CompilationUnit for easier extensibility. -l
command line option added for number of columns for wrapping (Lee Wilson). -f
command line switch to save a file immediately from the command line (Lee
Wilson). Compilation unit (Java source file) I/O has been centralized, so
hopefully this will make adding new command-line options a little easier.

<li><b>Beta 0.62 1999-04-28</b>. Fixed comment parsing problem introduced in
0.61. Command-line option to scan a list of files for uncommented code (Stefan
Tandecki). Removed spurious error message when clicking "Cancel" button from
file open dialog (bug report by Stefan Tandecki). Multiple files now accepted
on the command line.

<li><b>Beta 0.61 1999-04-22</b>. Upgraded to Swing 1.1 (Thorsten Ludewig and
Simon Arthur). The binary
version is now distributed in two forms: one which includes the Swing
libraries, and one which doesn't. Comment parsing fix (Jochen Bedersdorfer).
DocWiz now checks to see if the file has changed on disk while you're working
on it and asks you how you want to proceed if it has. Miscellaneous spurious
dependencies removed (bug reports from Boi Sletterink, Andreas Ludwig and
Thorsten Ludewig). Vastly improved source view pane. Packages changed to
com.tinyplanet for consistency on the Giant Java Tree, and the startup
command changed to reflect this. Miscellaneous minor bugfixes.

<li><b>Beta 0.60 1999-01-02</b>. You can now specify a
file name when starting DocWiz. An additional class has been added to the
default package in order to make it easier to start DocWiz from the command
line. The last non-open-source class has been eliminated.

<li><b>Beta 0.59
1998-12-02</b>. GUI layout and textfield space improvements. Problem with
switching away from an actively editing grid fixed. Word wrapping for tagged
paragraphs. Tagged paragraphs with tab characters now parsed properly (bug
report by Stephanie Bodoff). @deprecated tag support. @since support for
methods and constructors. Compilation problem with reference to dlgInputFrm
(report by Khalid).

<li><b>Beta 0.58 1998-10-4</b>. @return <i>really</i> fixed. Some aesthetic changes.

<li><b>Beta 0.57 1998-9-30</b>. Improved performance when formatted comment window
is open. @return and @version fields fixed.

<li><b>Beta 0.56 1998-9-25</b>. Fixed constructor toString() method to not say
"null". Separated panels for ExecutableElements, Classes and Fields into separate
files. Made panes resizable. Fixed bug with parsing newline-openbrace indent style
declarations (bug report by Dr. Gregory A. Harrison and Eric W. Worden).
Code contributed by Ramon M. Felciano to automatically update formatted comment
window when typing. Element selection list now displays "completeness" of comments
with an icon. Compile problem due to bad import statement (bug report by
Rose). Data entry panels now initially hidden (bug
report by Francesco "Kinkie" Chemolli).

<li><b>Beta 0.55 1998-7-29</b>. Fixed problem with tab characters at beginning of
comment lines (bug report courtesy of Stephen Zagerman). Fixed multi-line tagged
paragraph problem (bug report courtesy of Paulseph-John Farrugia). Swing 1.0.3 now
being used for development. Use of non-open-source libraries reduced. Comments
now line up with the code elements per P-JF and Sun recommendation.

<li><b>Beta 0.54 1998-7-19</b>. Source view pane added, UI changed to fit it in.

<li><b>Beta 0.53 1998-7-5</b>. Many more bugs fixed, including problems with
interfaces, UI display problems, creeping comments, and expanding tags. Also,
I'm now using DocWiz to comment my code.

<li><b>Beta 0.52 1998-7-3</b>. Use of Swing components expanded; reliance on
non-open-source components reduced. Many minor bugs fixed.
<li><b>Beta 0.51 1998-6-12</b>. Problem when writing multiple comments fixed.
<li><b>Beta 0.5 1998-6-10</b>. Significantly more stable version
 which uses <A HREF="http://www.suntest.com/JavaCC/">
JavaCC</a> as its parsing engine. UI based upon Swing. Licensing defined as GPL.
<li><b>(Unnumbered Version) 1998-1-11</b>. Based upon&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.promigos.ch/kramer">iDoc
- the Java(tm) Documentation QA Tool</A> and <A HREF="http://www.antLR.org/">ANTLR</A>, a
parser creation tool for Java.
