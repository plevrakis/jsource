DocWiz allows you to add JavaDoc comments to your source code easily.
With DocWiz, there's no need to tediously hand-format JavaDoc comments,
adding tags and comment structures for each method.
For those without Java, here's a screenshot of what you're missing:

<H2> Using DocWiz</H2>
You can start using DocWiz by
downloading the <A HREF="DocWizDist.jar">JAR file</A>  and then
running DocWiz by doing the following: <OL> <LI> Add DocWizDist.jar to your
CLASSPATH environment variable</LI>

<LI>
Run DocWiz with the following command:</LI>

<PRE>java SIMONARTHUR.docwiz.appDocWiz</PRE>
</OL>
Windows/DOS users may want to try <a href="docwiz.bat">the batch file</a>, contributed by
Nat Mills, instead.
<p>
You can then open a Java source file by choosing <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">File
| Open</FONT></B> from the menu. DocWiz will then provide a list of all
the fields, methods and classes defined in that file. Click on any of these
code elements to display a fill-in form for information about this code.

<P>At any time, you can see what the JavaDoc comment for a code element
will look like by choosing <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">View | Formatted
Comment</FONT></B>.

<P>When you're satisfied with the changes you've made, select <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">File
| Save</FONT></B> to save your current file. DocWiz will make a backup
copy of the original file by appending .BAK onto the end of the original
name.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Troubleshooting</H2>
<p>You need a JDK 1.1 compatible JVM to run DocWiz.
<p>Most users will need to <a
href="http://java.sun.com:80/products/jfc/index.html"> download Swing
1.0.3</a> from Javasoft's web site and add the swingall.jar file to the
CLASSPATH before running DocWiz.
<P>Some people have reported problems downloading the JAR file, seeing a Smart
Update error. These users will need to save the file to disk. With Netscape:
Right-click on <A HREF="DocWizDist.jar">this link to the JAR file</a> and
choose <b><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Save Link As</font></b> from the popup
menu.

<H2>Versions</H2>
<ul>
<li><b>Beta 0.59 1998-12-2</b>. GUI layout and textfield space improvements.
Problem with switching away from an actively editing grid fixed. Word wrapping
for tagged paragraphs. Tagged paragraphs with tab characters now parsed properly
(bug report by Stephanie Bodoff). @deprecated tag support. @since support for
methods and constructors. Compilation problem with reference to dlgInputFrm
(report by Khalid).

<li><b>Beta 0.58 1998-10-4</b>. @return <i>really</i> fixed. Some aesthetic changes.

<li><b>Beta 0.57 1998-9-30</b>. Improved performance when formatted comment window
is open. @return and @version fields fixed.

<li><b>Beta 0.56 1998-9-25</b>. Fixed constructor toString() method to not say
"null". Separated panels for ExecutableElements, Classes and Fields into separate
files. Made panes resizable. Fixed bug with parsing newline-openbrace indent style
declarations (bug report by Dr. Gregory A. Harrison and Eric W. Worden).
Code contributed by Ramon M. Felciano to automatically update formatted comment
window when typing. Element selection list now displays "completeness" of comments
with an icon. Compile problem due to bad import statement (bug report by
Rose). Data entry panels now initially hidden (bug
report by Francesco "Kinkie" Chemolli).

<li><b>Beta 0.55 1998-7-29</b>. Fixed problem with tab characters at beginning of
comment lines (bug report courtesy of Stephen Zagerman). Fixed multi-line tagged
paragraph problem (bug report courtesy of Paulseph-John Farrugia). Swing 1.0.3 now
being used for development. Use of non-open-source libraries reduced. Comments
now line up with the code elements per P-JF and Sun recommendation.

<li><b>Beta 0.54 1998-7-19</b>. Source view pane added, UI changed to fit it in.

<li><b>Beta 0.53 1998-7-5</b>. Many more bugs fixed, including problems with
interfaces, UI display problems, creeping comments, and expanding tags. Also,
I'm now using DocWiz to comment my code.

<li><b>Beta 0.52 1998-7-3</b>. Use of Swing components expanded; reliance on
non-open-source components reduced. Many minor bugs fixed.
<li><b>Beta 0.51 1998-6-12</b>. Problem when writing multiple comments fixed.
<li><b>Beta 0.5 1998-6-10</b>. Significantly more stable version
 which uses <A HREF="http://www.suntest.com/JavaCC/">
JavaCC</a> as its parsing engine. UI based upon Swing. Licensing defined as GPL.
<li><b>(Unnumbered Version) 1998-1-11</b>. Based upon&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.promigos.ch/kramer">iDoc
- the Java(tm) Documentation QA Tool</A> and <A HREF="http://www.antLR.org/">ANTLR</A>, a
parser creation tool for Java.

<H2>Bugs</H2>

<li>There's a problem with aligning the JavaDoc comment when the code item is
indented with tabs.
<li>Under Solaris, the About dialog doesn't display correctly.
<li>DocWiz doesn't check for read-only files, bad when you're using some version
control systems.

<H2>
To Do</H2>
Upcoming features include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Elimination of all non-open source libraries. It'll be tough to eliminate
Borland's GridBagConstraints2 while keeping a maintainable UI.
<li>Better separation of user interface and data structure code for embedding in
other environments
<li>Your most wanted features! Write to <A HREF="mailto:docwiz@hyper-g.com">

<h3>The <a href="docWizSource.zip">source code</a> is available. </h3>
It should be interesting to Java developers, as it
includes an application of using JavaCC in a GUI environment. Unless you're using
JBuilder, you'll need <a href="DocWizDist.jar">the JAR file</a> to compile the
program. The JAR file contains classes for which I'm not allowed to distribute the source.

<h3>The Buzz on DocWiz</h3>
<a href="http://www.afu.com/javafaq.html#Further Resources">The Java Programmers FAQ</a>
mentions DocWiz. If you work with Java, you should read it. Now.
<p>
DocWiz is mentioned in Sun's
<a href ="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/javadoc/faq.html#writingtools">Javadoc FAQ</a>,
also a must read document.

<p>It got a mention in <a href="http://www.softwareview.com/thesof09.htm">The
Software View</a>

<p><a href="http://www.developer.com/directories/cmpjava/dir.java.util.general.5.html">
Developer.com calls DocWiz "Useful"</a>
 and gives it one of those little fan icons: <img src="http://www.developer.com/images/cool.gif">
